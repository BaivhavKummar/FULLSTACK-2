## Experiment 3.1: Basic Client-Side Routing Using React Router

### Aim
To implement basic client-side routing in a Single Page Application using React Router.

### Software Requirements
- Node.js
- React
- React Router DOM
- Web Browser

### Theory
Routing in a Single Page Application allows navigation between different views without reloading the page. React Router is a popular library used to handle client-side routing in React applications using components such as `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`. This provides a dynamic and fluid user experience.

### Procedure
1. Create a React application.
2. Install `react-router-dom` package.
3. Wrap the application with `BrowserRouter`.
4. Define routes using `Routes` and `Route` components, mapping paths to specific components.
5. Implement basic navigation to test page transitions without a full page reload.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
