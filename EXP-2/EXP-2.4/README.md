## Experiment 4: Responsive Navigation Bar & Client-Side Routing

### Aim
To design a responsive navigation bar using a UI component library and implement client-side routing within a Single Page Application. This experiment demonstrates both a generic routing SPA and a personal profile dashboard.

### Procedure
1. Import a Navbar component from a UI library (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI, or a custom one).
2. Add navigation links to different sections/pages of the SPA.
3. Ensure responsiveness of the navigation bar across various screen sizes.
4. Integrate a routing library (like React Router DOM) to manage client-side navigation without full page reloads.
5. Define routes for different sections (e.g., Home, Features, Contact, Dashboard, Profile, Skills, About).
6. Implement distinct components for each route.

### Output

**Routing SPA:**

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
