## Experiment 2.1: Designing UI Using Bootstrap Components

### Aim
To design a responsive user interface using a component library (Bootstrap) in a Single Page Application.

### Software Requirements
- Node.js
- React
- Bootstrap
- Web Browser

### Theory
Component libraries provide pre-built, reusable UI components that help developers build consistent and responsive user interfaces quickly. Bootstrap is a popular CSS-based component library offering ready-made components like buttons, cards, forms, and navigation bars.

### Procedure
1. Create a React application.
2. Install Bootstrap using npm.
3. Import Bootstrap CSS into the project.
4. Design UI using Bootstrap components such as buttons, cards, and forms.
5. Run and observe the application.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
