## Experiment 2.1: Designing UI Using Bootstrap Components

### Aim
To design a responsive user interface using a component library (Bootstrap) in a Single Page Application.

### Software Requirements
- Node.js
- React
- Bootstrap
- Web Browser

### Theory
Component libraries provide pre-built, reusable UI components that help developers build consistent and responsive user interfaces quickly. Bootstrap is a popular CSS-based component library offering ready-made components like buttons, cards, forms, and navigation bars.

### Procedure
1. Create a React application.
2. Install Bootstrap using npm.
3. Import Bootstrap CSS into the project.
4. Design UI using Bootstrap components such as buttons, cards, and forms.
5. Run and observe the application.

## Experiment 2.2: Card-Based Layout Using Bootstrap

### Aim
To create a card-based UI layout using Bootstrap components. This experiment also features modern glassmorphism aesthetics.

### Procedure
1. Import Bootstrap CSS.
2. Use Bootstrap card and grid system to arrange content.
3. Display multiple cards dynamically.
4. Apply custom CSS for glassmorphism effects.

## Experiment 2.3: UI Design Using Material UI Components (Course Dashboard)

### Aim
To design a user interface using Material UI components in React, specifically creating a course dashboard.

### Software Requirements
- React
- Material UI (`@mui/material`)

### Theory
Material UI is a React-based component library that follows Google's Material Design principles. It provides ready-to-use components such as buttons, text fields, cards, and layouts, which are ideal for building rich and interactive dashboards.

### Procedure
1. Install Material UI packages.
2. Import required components (e.g., Grid, Card, Button).
3. Design the course dashboard UI using Material UI elements, including dynamic display of course cards.
4. Implement enrollment functionality with user feedback.
5. Implement logout functionality.

## Experiment 4: Responsive Navigation Bar & Client-Side Routing

### Aim
To design a responsive navigation bar using a UI component library and implement client-side routing within a Single Page Application. This experiment demonstrates both a generic routing SPA and a personal profile dashboard.

### Procedure
1. Import a Navbar component from a UI library (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI, or a custom one).
2. Add navigation links to different sections/pages of the SPA.
3. Ensure responsiveness of the navigation bar across various screen sizes.
4. Integrate a routing library (like React Router DOM) to manage client-side navigation without full page reloads.
5. Define routes for different sections (e.g., Home, Features, Contact, Dashboard, Profile, Skills, About).
6. Implement distinct components for each route.

### Output

**Routing SPA:**
