## Experiment 2.3: UI Design Using Material UI Components (Course Dashboard)

### Aim
To design a user interface using Material UI components in React, specifically creating a course dashboard.

### Software Requirements
- React
- Material UI (`@mui/material`)

### Theory
Material UI is a React-based component library that follows Google's Material Design principles. It provides ready-to-use components such as buttons, text fields, cards, and layouts, which are ideal for building rich and interactive dashboards.

### Procedure
1. Install Material UI packages.
2. Import required components (e.g., Grid, Card, Button).
3. Design the course dashboard UI using Material UI elements, including dynamic display of course cards.
4. Implement enrollment functionality with user feedback.
5. Implement logout functionality.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
